We’re small but experienced:
3 part-time developers (Laravel + Vue)
1 AI engineer (project basis)
1 founder-product lead (you’ll work directly with her)
We move quickly, iterate constantly, and deploy to our dev environment several times a week. We need someone who can think fast, be resourceful, and guide us toward a sustainable QA rhythm.
We’re looking for a senior QA engineer who’s comfortable working independently and understands how to test integrated systems — not just click through screens.
You’ll own QA for features that combine:
Complex dependencies (e.g., two session transcripts must exist before generating a coaching plan)
AI-driven outputs (prompt-based summaries, plan generation)
UX/UI validation (checking screens against Figma and suggesting CX improvements)
Data-seeded testing (creating personas and sample data to simulate user states)
Integrations (connecting Slack / Teams test workspaces to verify end-to-end flows)

Our students consistently achieve exceptional results in school assessments, selective entry exams, and university preparation.
Behind the scenes, we run on lean operations, AI-driven automation, and modern tech systems. That is how we have been able to scale so quickly while maintaining a premium learning experience for every student.
We have been recognized three years in a row as one of the Australian Financial Review's Fastest Growing Startups, but growth is not our endgame. Our vision is bigger: to build the most effective education platform in Australia, combining human teaching with technology, and to empower every student to achieve their potential.

I’m seeking a tech-savvy, detail-oriented Virtual Assistant to help bring structure and flow to my business systems. The immediate focus is completing my Systeme.io setup, integrating a booking calendar with three offers, and testing all automations through to the first sale.
This is a milestone-based project with potential for ongoing collaboration if we’re a good fit. You should be comfortable with both the technical side of funnel building and the strategic understanding of how automations connect to real conversions.
Initial Objectives (Phase 1):
• Set up a booking calendar with 3 distinct offers (details provided upon hire).
• Complete and optimize my Systeme.io backend — connect email sequences, automations, and payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal).
• Test all funnel flows for smooth functionality from opt-in to checkout to confirmation.
• Deliver a brief report outlining what’s been set up, what’s working, and any suggested improvements.
Milestone Markers:
• Milestone 1: Calendar setup + Systeme.io connected to payments and emails.
• Milestone 2: Funnel tested and optimized with documented adjustments.
• Milestone 3: Funnel launch and confirmed first successful test sale or booking.
Tech Stack Alignment:
You should be confident working within — or integrating with — my current ecosystem of tools:
• Wix (website builder)
• Systeme.io (funnels, automations, email marketing)
• Canva (design assets + branded templates)
• Google Workspace (email, calendar, file management)
• Stripe / PayPal (payments and invoicing)
What I’m Looking For:
• Proven experience building or optimizing Systeme.io funnels.
• Understanding of how automations support user experience and conversion.
• Strong communication skills — able to walk me through your process clearly and confidently.
• Attention to clean, cohesive design and user flow.
• Self-starter attitude — proactive, organized, and results-oriented.
**Application Requirements:
Five examples of funnels you’ve built or optimized (screenshots, live links, or case studies).
A short description of your workflow process — from funnel setup to first sale.
Confirmation of your experience with my tech stack (see list above).
Your availability for an onboarding call.
Your time estimate and hourly rate or project-based pricing for Phase 1.
Bonus Skills:
• Familiarity with digital product launches, affiliate setup, or online course funnels.
• Experience working with creative, wellness, or design-focused brands.
• Bilingual (English/Spanish) is a plus — some communications are based in Puerto Rico.
We are seeking a skilled Virtual Assistant to assist in setting up a funnel on Systeme.io for our Creative Studio brand.

Summary
We need a tiny AI/automation that counts how many messages a specific bot posts in a given Slack channel each day. Each bot message = one sale. At the end of the day, the agent should post a single summary message to Slack with the total sales count.
What you’ll build
* A lightweight agent (Node.js or Python or make.com acceptable) that:
1. Reads messages in one Slack channel for the current day.
2. Filters only messages from a specific bot (by bot_id, username, or a unique text pattern).
3. Counts them and posts an EOD summary back to Slack (e.g., “EOD Sales — 03 Nov 2025: 27”).
4. Runs automatically daily (cron/scheduler or automation platform).
* Timezone for EOD: IST (Asia/Kolkata) by default.
Deliverables
* Working automation connected to our Slack workspace.
* Clean, commented code or exportable scenario (if using Make/Zapier).
* Readme with setup steps (env vars, scopes, scheduling).
* One configurable file/variable for: channel ID, bot filter, post-to channel, and EOD time.
Technical Notes (Slack)
* Use Slack Web API (e.g., conversations.history) or an automation platform module.
* Likely OAuth scopes: channels:history (public) and/or groups:history (private), channels:read, chat:write.
* Filter logic: by bot_id or robust text match (we’ll provide the bot/app identifier).
* Summary format: EOD Sales — DD Mon YYYY: count.
Nice to Have (optional)
* Also log daily counts to Google Sheet/CSV.
* Simple error alert to Slack if API fails.
Acceptance Criteria
* Agent posts the correct count at the set EOD time (IST) for 2 consecutive days.
* Manual spot-check of the day’s messages matches the posted total.
* Easy to change channel ID/bot filter/time without code edits (env/config).
Budget & Timeline
* Fixed price: $10 (non-negotiable).
Who should apply (Location restricted)
* Only freelancers based in Pakistan or Bangladesh.
* You’ve built Slack apps/automations before (please share 1–2 examples).
* Comfortable with OAuth scopes, cron/scheduling, and basic logging.
What we provide
* Slack workspace/app setup access.
* Channel ID and bot identifier details.
* Quick testing support.
How to apply (short & specific)
1. Confirm you’re in Pakistan or Bangladesh.
2. State your approach (Node/Python vs. Make/Zapier) in 3–5 lines.
3. List the Slack scopes you’ll request.
4. Share 1–2 relevant Slack/automation links or brief descriptions.
5. Include the word “chai” so we know you read this.",10.0,10.0,10.0,India,India,TRUE,Posted last week,2025-11-03T06:31:34.792Z,Fixed,Intermediate,,"Adobe Illustrator, Java, English, Graphic Design, Automation",,,none,individual_or_undefined,none

I reviewed your project summary and propose building a single automation Agent that implements the four phases (Research → Recruitment → Management & Tracking → Scaling & Measurement). I suggest starting with an MVP version of the Agent. This MVP provides a fast, low-cost way to test and validate the Ambassador Program before committing to full-scale automation.
Key impacts of the MVP:
1.	Begin capturing and managing ambassadors immediately.
2.	Demonstrate progress and generate momentum.
3.	Learn and refine before scaling globally.
MVP Core Workflows:
✅ Research Agent (University List Builder)
•	Collect universities in 2–3 pilot countries (USA, Canada, UK).
•	Normalize data → University Name, Country, City, Student Population, Source URL.
•	Export into a Google Sheet with structured columns.
✅ Recruitment Funnel (Signups)
•	Create a Google Form / Typeform for ambassador signups.
•	Form submissions stored automatically in a database (or Google Sheet for MVP).
•	Referral codes generated on signup.
•	Confirmation emails sent to applicants.
✅ Ambassador Dashboard (Tracking & Proofs)
•	Ambassador records mirrored in a Google Sheet dashboard.
•	Dropdowns for status (Applied, Onboarded, Active, Dropped).
•	Column for proof links (manual upload for MVP; automated in later phases).
•	Weekly summary email to admins with key stats (new signups, top universities, proof submissions).
📂 MVP Data Flow
•	University Research → output to CSV → load into Google Sheet (University Master List).
•	Recruitment → ambassador applies via Google Form; code is generated, record is added to Ambassador Sheet; welcome email is sent.
•	Dashboard → tracks statuses and proof links; weekly summary compiled and sent to admin team.
✅ Deliverables (MVP Package):
•	University Master Sheet (2–3 countries populated).
•	Ambassador Signup Form + auto-generated referral code.
•	Ambassador Dashboard Sheet (status tracking, proof links).
•	Automations: referral code generator, weekly summary email.
🛠️ MVP Tech Stack:
•	Python for automation tasks.
•	Google Sheets API or Apps Script for syncing data.
•	Google Forms for quick signup capture.
•	Apps Script automation for referral codes + record updates.
•	Gmail integration for welcome/confirmation emails.
•	Scheduler: time-based triggers for nightly tasks.
Looking forward to your approval of this solution. Once you confirm, I’ll prepare the detailed time and cost estimate.

you come in.
We’re looking for a remote tech systems expert who specializes in GoHighLevel and thrives behind the
scenes — someone who finds joy in building clean automations, connecting tools, and making workflows feel
effortless for the people using them. You love when systems just work, and you're the kind of person who
documents everything, anticipates problems before they happen, and quietly keeps the digital wheels turning.
If you’re a fast, detail-driven problem solver who loves clean interfaces, solid logic, and async collaboration —
and you’re energized by working on meaningful projects with a small team that values trust and autonomy —
we’d love to connect.

CRM — including managing pipelines, building smart automations, segmenting contacts, and ensuring
everything integrates cleanly across tools.
You’ll also help maintain and refine our website so it stays current, clear, and aligned with our marketing and
enrollment goals. This is not a strategy role — it’s an implementation and systems role for someone who
enjoys making things work. Your speed, technical sharpness, and ability to work independently will free up our
core team to focus on content, connection, and growth.

● You are the GoHighLevel person for the organization
● Lead Nurture System polished/updated in partnership with Marketing
● Maintain and improve the school’s website (images, layout, copy) in partnership with Marketing
● Maintain GoHighLevel calendar integrations and automation flow.
● Manage user settings and domains inside GoHighLevel.
● Organize and segment lead/contact lists for clean, effective communication.
● Keep GoHighLevel running smoothly for the entire team.
● Manage automations, pipelines, and contacts.
● Maintain website updates and improvements.
● Polish calendar flows and booking systems.

Who You Are:
● You’re a GoHighLevel pro with verifiable experience.
● You move fast, communicate clearly, and document thoroughly.
● You’re tech-savvy and solution-oriented.
● You’re reliable and comfortable working virtually.
● You already use ChatGPT and enjoy system-building.

● Someone who needs micromanaging.
● Someone who implements strategy unilaterally without collaboration.

● Proven GoHighLevel and website editing experience.
● Excellent documentation and troubleshooting skills.
● Ability to act quickly and efficiently (24–48 hr turnaround).

We have a mature unit testing spreadsheet for it.
We now have a a RESTful API which has a different workflow more closely aligned with Stripe's PaymentIntents process. In this workflow, a PaymentIntent object is created (like an invoice) and then a second object is created for a PaymentMethod (ie. card number). Those 2 items are connected and then charged via ""Capture"". This differs from the legacy method of posting all this data together in 1 payload.
The RESTful API has a server-side NodeJS SDK which invokes the API.
We have a comprehensive unit testing spreadsheet for the server-side SDK along with a few RESTful endpoints but we do not have a comprehensive RESTful unit test list. Only a few tests have been included.
The goal of this project is to create 1 comprehensive and up-dated unit test list for the RESTful API and its server-side library:
(1) Do a gap analysis of the ""Legacy"" XML ""charge/sale"" API tests against the ""New"" RESTful ""paymentIntents, paymentMethods, confirm/capture"" API documentation (to be provided).
(1. a) Identify which tests from the Legacy list are accounted for by a parallel test in the New list.
(1.b) Identify which tests from the Legacy list do not have an equivalent in the New list and therefore must be written.
(2) Write the unit tests in the New list which accomplish filling the gaps from 1.b. All tests must include steps to reproduce, expected results, URLs, URL parameters, headers, GET queries, and all probable permutations of POST/PUT payloads.

Vision:
We want to build an AI-powered chatbot via Meta Messaging API for recruitment agencies (starting with social workers) that automates compliance document collection, validation, and processing — including problem-solving steps where the system acts autonomously to resolve issues without recruiter intervention.
The goal: reduce recruiter admin, ensure compliance, and speed up placements by handling candidate interactions automatically while keeping recruiters informed.

Recruiter uploads candidate CV → AI generates a compliance checklist (DBS, HCPC registration, Right to Work, references, training certificates).
Suggested tools:
AI parsing: OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-5
Document checklist management: Airtable or Notion
Consent Step
Candidate receives a consent request via the messaging API to start with the bot.
Suggested tools:
Meta Messaging API messaging: WATI, 360dialog, Twilio API
Automation: Zapier or Make.com
Meta Messaging API Chatbot Engagement
Bot requests each document step-by-step.

Today, most Observability customers are stuck using multiple tools at once -- Datadog, New Relic, Sentry, Cloudwatch, Grafana, etc. -- creating data silos in each solution... or worse, duplicated data and costs.
We're working to eliminate those data silos by creating a cross-vendor AI that learns from those solutions and provides proactive insights to users -- saving them from having to dig through different products to find the answers they need.
OUR NEED
Our initial product is currently in an Alpha state that's ready for testing, and we're looking for several engineers (software, cloud, DevOps, SRE, etc.) who routinely interact with Observability solutions to help us out.
Everyone selected for this project will be asked to test an Alpha version of our AI that will need to be connected to their actual monitoring data. They will then be expected to provide feedback on the quality of the AI's responses, with notes on what specifically they'd like to see improved.
To qualify for this opportunity, you must have access to at least one Observability solution with real site and infrastructure data. (Non-production environments are perfectly acceptable for this testing!)
Testers with multiple monitoring solutions in place on the same sites/infrastructure are ideal.
SELECTION PROCESS
Applicants may be asked to hop on a quick 15 minute Zoom call with our founders so we can better understand their experience, existing monitoring solutions, and overall availability to test over the next 1-2 months.
AFTER BEING HIRED
We will ask each of the selected applicants to complete some of all of the following steps, depending on their current monitoring solutions.
1) For any tester using a monitoring solution we have not yet worked with, our Chief Architect will ask for permission to see examples of your raw monitoring data. This can be provided as raw output files (metrics, logs, traces), or you can choose to grant him temporary, limited access to a non-production monitoring account. This will allow us to ensure our AI can ingest and process telemetry data from that vendor properly.
2) For all Alpha testers, we will provision dedicated infrastructure in our cloud environment, and work with you to connect it to your monitoring solution(s).
3) You will be tasked with asking the AI questions and having it perform simple tasks for you. We then need to know (a) what prompts you used, (b) whether or not you were satisfied with the responses, and (c) what additional features you'd like to see.
This opportunity can involve multiple rounds of testing for engineers interested in an ongoing engagement.
In your proposal, please include:
1) Your hourly rate.
2) The specific Observability vendors you have access to, plus a brief summary of how many sites and how much infrastructure you're monitoring with them.
NOTE: This is neither a QA/QE opportunity, nor a request for someone to implement monitoring solutions on our platform for us. We are specifically looking for people who work with Observability data, that way they can more accurately verify that our AI's responses are accurate.

US → ABOUT ODYSSEY LAB 💡
We build high-standards systems, sites, and marketing operations that help local services punch above their weight.
Principles → ownership, craft, honesty, documentation-as-you-go, deep work, growth-orientation, tight feedback loops.
Start part-time on a paid trial; if we both like the fit and offer, ramp to 30–40 hrs/week. 👉 Freelancers only.
Prefer max overlap with US Central time during Weeks 1–2; we’ll taper as async proves out. Long-term, must continue to be available on key days to overlap and be available for US Central Time meetings (especially Monday 90 minute 11:30 am weekly team standup meeting).
HOW WE WORK (Trial Month Phase) ⚙️
• Upwork Hourly with Tracker and screenshots ON for exploratory projects.
• Manual time DISABLED; write a short memo for each session. First 2 weeks if there's a miss on time tracking, we'll handle it manually so you can build the habit, within reason. We all track time, owner included
• While the timer runs, you work only on Odyssey tasks.
• Daily async update in ClickUp; Weekly report due Friday 12:00 CT
• Minimum 2h US-Central overlap during trial (5 hours min. on Mondays)
• Buddy system: you’ll pair with the lead dev for fast onboarding
KEY EXPECTATIONS
• Read ""Deliverables"" for work scope, key requirements, multi-cultural/culture expectations, and nice-to-have skills for the role.
TRIAL COMP 💵
• Hours: 20–25 hrs/week
• Duration: 2–4 weeks (extend if productive)
• Rate: $4–5/hr (increase after baseline KPIs on retainer)
• Ramp path: trial → retainer → 30–40 hrs/week → potential FT contractor
WHY NOW / WHAT YOU’LL BUILD 🔧
We’re standardizing sites and ops after a pivot; immediate client launches need reusable sections, QA, speed, and reporting. Your work lays the base for scale and our push to $1M next year.
FINANCIAL GROWTH PLANS 🌱
In 2026 we plan to pilot a performance-tied phantom-equity/SARs program (cash-settled, no legal ownership transfer). Eligibility after 90 days and consistent “gate-pass” months; details shared later in the process. Ultimately, what this is = an opportunity to join a small, highly capable team undertaking a coordinated team/company growth plan toward our shared goals to grow together, financially, personally, and professionally. Together, your buddy on the dev team and the rest of us are on the hunt for the right talent to help us achieve these goals. If you’re smart, capable, driven, and into the sound of that, here’s what you need to know. 👇
OWNER MINDSET ✅
Act like an owner: raise risks early, keep promises, document as you work, and close the loop daily. We (including owner) track time, maintain strong routines, keep our standards and track our growth with metrics scorecards, and work hard to keep our commitments to each other and our clients.
WHO THRIVES / WHO DOESN’T 🎯
Thrives: solo pros, checklist lovers, tracker-comfortable, DRY builders, ClickUp learners, detail-obsessed shippers, open-minded, curious about other viewpoints, cultures, and ways of thinking and doing.
Doesn’t: multi-client jugglers during tracked time, “I’ll remember later” non-documenters, overlap-avoiders, closed mind, biases against working with any culture or group, low-initiative.
HOW TO APPLY 📨
1. Send 3 portfolio links and a Loom walkthrough of your favorite build.
2. Start your cover letter with the codeword: RISING-INK.
3. Confirm all of the following:
• You are a solo freelancer (not part of an agency).
• You agree to Upwork Tracker with screenshots, manual time OFF, and Odyssey-only focus while tracking.
• You will post a daily async update in ClickUp and a weekly report by Friday 12:00 CT.
4. Answer the 5 application questions on the post.
POLICY REMINDERS 📋
• Tracker required; manual time OFF; memos per session required
• Daily async update; Friday report by 12:00 CT
• Timer time = Odyssey-only focus
• If the Tracker fails, notify immediately; any correction is pre-approved and paid via bonus
(manual time stays off)

We’re looking for a QA Specialist who thrives on spotting what others miss — from the obvious bugs to the sneaky edge cases that only surface when you push a system to its limits. If you love designing test cases that cover every “what if” scenario, this role is for you.
⸻
What You’ll Do
•	Create, maintain, and execute comprehensive test cases that go beyond the happy path.
•	Identify and validate edge cases, stress scenarios, and real-world use situations.
•	Perform regression, integration, performance, and API testing.
•	Log issues with crystal-clear reproduction steps and track them through resolution.
•	Collaborate with developers and project managers to ensure features meet requirements.
•	Contribute to improving QA processes, automation coverage, and release quality.
⸻
What We’re Looking For
•	Proven experience in software QA (manual and/or automated).
•	Strong understanding of writing and structuring test cases.
•	An eye for edge cases and non-standard user behaviors.
•	Familiarity with testing tools like Postman, Cypress, Selenium, or Playwright.
•	Solid grasp of software development lifecycles and agile workflows.
•	Detail-driven problem-solver with excellent communication skills.
⸻
Why Join Us
•	Be the person who keeps systems safe from “it worked on my machine.”
•	Work in an environment where quality is championed, not rushed.
•	Shape QA processes and have a direct say in automation strategy.
•	Competitive pay, growth opportunities, and performance bonuses.

1. Accuracy Testing Harness
You will design and deliver a full evaluation environment that replaces slow, manual testing.
Core components:
Dataset ingestion: Load 10–20 expired bond/equity filings with ground truth values (coupon, maturity, conversions). Store them in a structured SQL or schema-driven format for repeated use.
Prompt runner: Run multiple prompt versions in parallel on the dataset. Automatically log all inputs and outputs.
Scoring engine: Compare outputs against ground truth. Generate metrics such as accuracy %, error categories, and nonsense detection (e.g., coupon = 75%).
Feedback loop: Track which prompts perform best, highlight recurring error patterns, and enable side-by-side comparisons.
Dashboard/interface: Provide a lightweight dashboard (Streamlit or equivalent) for analysts to filter by prompt version, document type, or error type.
Efficiency: Reduce refinement cycles from days to hours and enable quick experimentation.
2. Risk & Control Layer
A safety net to prevent risky or illogical outputs from reaching downstream systems.
Core components:
Rules engine: Hard-coded checks (e.g., coupon rates between 0–25%, deadlines not in the past). Extendable by Navvai/client analysts.
Validation logic: Cross-check related fields (e.g., record date before payment date). Ensure logical consistency.
Flagging system: Any outputs that break rules are flagged and logged with reasons.
Confidence scoring: Assign confidence levels (high, medium, low) to all extracted values. Low-confidence results are held back.
Audit & traceability: Log which page/section each value was extracted from. Enable full traceability for review and compliance.
Fail-safe mode: If an output fails critical checks, it is withheld automatically.",,,,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,FALSE,Posted 4 weeks ago,2025-09-19T11:12:11.375Z,Fixed,Expert,,"Database Testing, Bug Tracking & Reports, Component Testing, Stress Testing",,,none,individual_or_undefined,none

•	Outputs both long and short versions plus 3–5 hashtags.
4.	Creates an approval loop
•	Sends therapist an email or Slack message with video preview and caption for review.
•	Therapist clicks “Approve” or “Request Edit,” and workflow updates accordingly.
5.	Publishes to Instagram

We’re Clap.gg — a bite-size social game powered by the latest AI (Boost VC-backed). We’re inviting a small cohort (8–10 creators/social leads) to help shape the product before we open it up. Think new-age Jackbox meets TikTok: fast prompts, fun reactions, friendly competition. It’s legit résumé/portfolio cred for creators and social managers.
Kickoff options (Google Meet, ~20–25 min; includes the first live challenge)
Tue, Sept 16, 2025 @ 5:00 pm CT / 3:00 pm PT
Tue, Sept 16, 2025 @ 6:00 pm CT / 4:00 pm PT
Wed, Sept 17, 2025 @ 10:00 am CT / 8:00 am PT
If Thu (Sept 18) or Fri (Sept 19) works better, say so—we may open another slot.
How it works
Drops: Every Wednesday we release 3 surprise challenges (each 30–60 seconds).
Deadline: Please submit within 24 hours of each drop; if you’ll be delayed, just tell us—communication counts.
Feedback: 5-min weekly pulse + one 30-min 1:1 in Week 3 or Week 4 (after you’ve played a bit).
Discord (optional): Give live feedback directly to the team (engineers included).
Light physical prompts: May appear (e.g., balance a pen). They’re optional and always have a safe alternative.
Time commitment
~45–60 min/week, total ~2.5–3 hours across the cohort.
Compensation
One fixed-price Upwork contract (no milestones).
Prizes: Each challenge has a $15 prize pool shared among the best/quickest valid entries. Prize winnings are delivered via Visa e-gift card within 72 hours after each challenge ends.
Creator fit (you’ll shine if…)
You’re 18+, comfortable on camera, and love trying new social/game formats.
Backgrounds that stand out: content creators, social media managers, UGC editors, gamers/testers, improv/actors.
You have a smartphone or webcam and solid internet.
How to apply
Submit a proposal on Upwork and answer the two screening questions in the post (your kickoff preference + favorite game).
In your proposal, include: your device (iPhone/Android/desktop) and timezone, plus one line on why this sounds fun for you.
Next steps
We’ll review proposals and hire on Upwork. After hire, we’ll collect your email to send the Google Meet invite and game links. Peek the vibe at Clap.gg—we’re building a culture of play that rewards authentic, human creativity.
Spots are limited so voices don’t get lost—if this feels like you, jump in.

To design, implement, and optimize intelligent automations across GoHighLevel (GHL), OpenAI, and n8n — streamlining operations, enhancing client delivery, and driving revenue through AI-powered funnels, bots, and voice agents.
Alignment with FUNCSHUN Core Values
•	Extreme Ownership: You don’t just automate tasks — you own outcomes and performance of the systems you build.
•	Transparency: All automations are documented in Notion and communicated clearly with team and stakeholders.
•	Kaizen Mindset: You proactively find and suggest optimizations using GPT, AI agents, and APIs.
•	Customer Obsession: Every funnel, chatbot, or voice agent improves client experience and reduces human error.
•	Security-First Thinking: You consider permissioning, audit trails, and access controls in every automation.
Responsibilities
•	- Design and launch GHL funnels (landing pages, surveys, opt-ins, calendars)
•	- Create and manage automated GHL workflows (follow-ups, tags, triggers, lead scoring)
•	- Build high-conversion email and SMS campaigns inside GHL
•	- Develop and train AI voice agents (Twilio integrated or GHL native)
•	- Build and embed AI chatbots using OpenAI/GHL integrations
•	- Manage CRM pipelines and customize contact/lead flows in GHL
•	- Use n8n/Make to connect external tools or webhooks to GHL
•	- Design prompt workflows for internal/external GPT usage
•	- Document every build with SOPs and Loom walkthroughs
Tech Stack
•	- Must-Have: GoHighLevel, OpenAI, n8n, Make, Zapier, Notion
•	- Nice to Have: Airtable, Tally.so, Webflow, Google Workspace, IT Glue
•	- Familiarity with APIs, JSON, Webhooks, Regex is a strong plus
Success Metrics
•	- Launches 2 GHL funnel systems + 3 automations in first 30 days
•	- Reduces 10+ hours/month of manual follow-up via automation by Day 60
•	- Delivers 1 AI-powered chatbot or voice agent supporting leads or clients by Day 90
Culture Fit
•	- You think like a systems architect and act like a doer
•	- You understand funnel psychology and automation logic
•	- You love crafting GPT prompts as much as building workflows
•	- You document as you go and thrive on async collaboration

W're hoping this can turn into a long-term partnership, and as our agency grows, your compensation will grow with it. What you’ll do:
- Design n8n workflows (error-tolerant, idempotent, retry/queue aware) to integrate Vapi, webhooks, CRMs (HubSpot/Zoho/GHL), Google Sheets/BigQuery, Slack, email, and payment providers.
- Build and document REST/GraphQL API calls, OAuth connections, and webhook endpoints (parse JSON, map payloads, sanitize/validate inputs).
- Orchestrate Vapi call flows: create intents, handle post-call webhooks, push transcripts/analytics, and trigger downstream automations.
- Add monitoring & observability (run logs, alerting, dead-letter queues, “circuit breaker” steps).
- Ship small internal tools when needed (Node/TypeScript or Python) to fill gaps.
- Maintain documentation (readme-level runbooks) and create reusable templates/modules.
- Partner with our team to scope requirements into fast, testable MVP automations.
Must-have skills:
- n8n power-user (HTTP Request, Function/Code, IF/Switch, Wait, Webhook, Error Trigger, workflow exports/imports).
- Strong JavaScript/TypeScript for function nodes and lightweight services.
- Solid API fundamentals: REST, auth (API keys/OAuth2), pagination, rate limits, retries/backoff, idempotency keys.
- JSON wrangling: mapping, schema validation, transformation.
- Practical Git workflow and environment separation (dev/stage/prod).
- Clear written communication and habit of documenting what you ship.
Nice-to-haves:
- Vapi experience (agents, STT/TTS settings, call events, post-call actions).
- Experience with GoHighLevel/HubSpot/Zoho, Twilio, Make/Zapier, PostHog/Sentry/Datadog.
- Basic SQL; Google Sheets/Apps Script; Airtable; Supabase/Firebase.
- Security hygiene (secrets management, PII redaction, least-privilege keys).
Success looks like
- 99% workflow success rate with alerts on the remaining 1%.
- Less than 1 hour mean time to recovery on failed runs.
- Documented, reusable modules that cut build time by 50% on repeat patterns.

---
Our automated Playwright test for video playback (Case 38) consistently fails, even though the same steps succeed when done manually. The automation logs in, reaches the lesson, and sees the video manifest, but playback never actually starts. Because of that, the downloader panel never detects any media, and the test times out.
**What We Know:**
* Login and navigation work fine.
* The video manifest is captured during the run.
* Playback errors occur in automation that don’t appear manually.
* The video element stays paused, so nothing gets registered for download.
**What We Tried:**
* Switching browsers (bundled Chromium vs. system Chrome).
* Adding permissions and adjusting extension logic.
* Forcing playback programmatically.
* Adding extensive logging.
Everything shows up fine in the actual chrome extension 'sidepanel' display but as far as i know this cannot be automated so we are mimicing that by opening the panel in a full new tab... and cant seem to get it to show up there (used to show)",16.0,28.0,22.0,United States,United States,TRUE,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-10-01T19:16:27.880Z,Hourly,Expert,,"JavaScript, Software QA, Web Testing, Automated Testing",The video manifest,the video manifest,high,individual_or_undefined,is_plain

The goal is to confirm clean data flow, connection integrity, and precise execution timing between the Bridge, DLL, and broker feed.
This project focuses purely on infrastructure verification — no strategy or trading logic development is required.
The environment includes a Bridge folder, a placeholder DLL, and a VWAP-based test strategy used only to confirm stable connectivity and latency metrics.
Tasks include:
• Verify connection flow between Bridge, DLL, and Broker feed
• Confirm data consistency, tick rate stability, and event synchronization
• Measure and report latency (p95 under 300 ms), speed 90 percent or higher, and fill percent
• Ensure 3 ms buffer is active with no double-fires
• Log and summarize performance metrics (speed %, latency %, fill %, slippage %)
• Monitor for feed pauses beyond 250 ms
• Conduct multiple test runs for consistency
• Maintain short follow-up communication for any fine-tuning after review
Ideal background:
Experience with NinjaTrader 8, C#, DLL integration (P/Invoke), and low-latency data testing.

We are developing a multi-tenant AI SaaS platform with complex API-driven functionality and integrations with major external services. The system incorporates real-time communication/telephony (Twilio, SIP, or similar), AI/LLM integration, and an API-heavy architecture (Google/Outlook, Stripe, Zapier, etc.).
To ensure quality and compliance, we require an independent QA Auditor to act as a client-side quality monitor. This role is critical — you will verify milestone deliverables, oversee all aspects of testing, and issue formal QA Certification Reports tied directly to milestone acceptance. No deliverable will be approved until you certify it meets agreed standards.
Responsibilities
Review and approve milestone-specific Acceptance Test Plans.
Monitor deliverables against scope, specifications, and quality standards.
Execute or oversee functional, integration, load, and compliance testing.
Conduct performance and scalability tests (100+ concurrent users, latency benchmarks).
Validate multi-tenant security, data isolation, and compliance measures.
Deliver formal QA Certification Reports per milestone (pass/fail summary, defect log, recommendations).
Requirements:
5+ years’ experience in QA/QC for SaaS or complex multi-tenant platforms.
Strong background in functional, performance, scalability, and security testing.
Proficiency with QA tools such as JMeter, Locust, Postman, Selenium, or equivalents.
Experience with API-heavy systems, telephony/VoIP (Twilio, SIP), and AI/LLM integrations strongly preferred.
Ability to produce clear, professional QA reports suitable for contractual acceptance.
Must operate independently of the development team and report directly to the client.
Engagement Model:
Project spans multiple milestones over several months.
QA Auditor will provide oversight and certification at each stage.
Commitment is part-time and milestone-driven (not full-time).",,,,Qatar,Qatar,TRUE,Posted 4 weeks ago,2025-09-20T18:40:32.109Z,Fixed,Expert,,"Load Testing, Performance Testing, Security Testing, API Testing",This role,this role,high,product_company,is_plain

We’re a fast-paced tech company building platforms where reliability, accuracy, and performance are critical. We’re looking for a QA Specialist who thrives on spotting what others miss — from the obvious bugs to the sneaky edge cases that only surface when you push a system to its limits. If you love designing test cases that cover every “what if” scenario, this role is for you.
⸻
What You’ll Do
• Create, maintain, and execute comprehensive test cases that go beyond the happy path.
• Identify and validate edge cases, stress scenarios, and real-world use situations.
• Perform regression, integration, performance, and API testing.
• Log issues with crystal-clear reproduction steps and track them through resolution.
• Collaborate with developers and project managers to ensure features meet requirements.
• Contribute to improving QA processes, automation coverage, and release quality.
• IMPORTANT : For now, the workload will fluctuate — some days there’ll be just a bit to do, and other days will be busier. We’re not looking for someone who’s focused only on working per hour; if that’s your mindset, this isn’t the right fit. We have a fixed rate that we feel is fair for the stage we’re in — the beginning of development — and this will increase and grow into a full-time role as the project progresses.
⸻
What We’re Looking For
• Proven experience in software QA (manual and automated).
• Strong understanding of writing and structuring test cases.
• An eye for edge cases and non-standard user behaviors.
• Familiarity with testing tools like Postman, Cypress, Selenium, or Playwright.
• Solid grasp of software development lifecycles and agile workflows.
• Detail-driven problem-solver with excellent communication skills.
• Someone who doesn't sit and watch the clock but rather gets the work done.
⸻
Why Join Us
• Be the person who keeps systems safe from “it worked on my machine.”
• Work in an environment where quality is championed, not rushed.
• Shape QA processes and have a direct say in automation strategy.
• Competitive pay, growth opportunities, and performance bonuses.

This isn’t a typical QA role. You don’t need to come from a QA background at all. What we actually need is someone who understands how full-stack platforms work, who knows how to use wallets, connect them, send transactions, and interact with smart contracts — and who can spot when something feels off.
You can be a developer, a project manager, or just someone super technical and curious. What matters is that you’re **detail-oriented, resourceful**, and have the right mindset. You’re not just going through features and saying “yep, that works” — you’re actively trying to find bugs, inconsistencies, or weird behaviors in how our platforms function.
Basically, your job is to **try to break what we build** — and help us make sure it’s perfect before we push it live.
---
### ⚙️ What You’ll Be Doing
- Manually testing Web3 platforms (web apps and Telegram bots).
- Checking wallet connection flows, transactions, balances, and smart contract interactions.
- Reporting bugs clearly — what happened, what should’ve happened, and how to reproduce it.
- Helping confirm that fixes actually work before deployment.
- Working closely with our dev and PM teams to make sure everything runs smoothly.
---
### 🧩 What We’re Looking For
**You should:**
- Understand how wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Phantom, etc.) work.
- Be familiar with sending transactions, signing messages, interacting with contracts, etc.
- Know your way around dApps — ideally both EVM and Solana-based.
- Have a good eye for details and user experience.
- Be comfortable communicating clearly in English.
You don’t need to be a QA engineer or have done this professionally before. If you’ve built or used enough Web3 products and understand how they work end-to-end, that’s exactly what we need.
---
### 💼 Details
- **Type:** Contractor / Part-time (10–20h per week to start)
- **Location:** Fully remote
- **Schedule:** Flexible (just be available when we’re testing new releases)
- **Pay:** Hourly, competitive based on experience

This is a leadership role — not a junior tester, not an automation-only engineer, and not someone who has only worked inside large QA teams where structure already existed.
We’re looking for someone who has built, led, or rebuilt QA processes at growing software companies and understands how to balance manual testing, automation, and release rigor.
If you know how to run a clean, predictable, professional QA function — you’ll be a great fit.
What You Will Own
This role has real authority. You’ll control:
Quality Strategy
Create and manage our full QA process
Define coverage requirements for manual, integration, and automated testing
Maintain regression plans and test case libraries
Establish standards for bug quality and acceptance criteria
Identify risks before they become issues
Staging & Releases
Own staging environment integrity
Validate release readiness
Approve or block releases
Ensure critical workflows are always covered
Coordinate closely with engineering on build quality
Team Coordination
You will direct:
Manual QA (already strong) — assign test cases, review results
Automation Engineer (part-time or full-time) — set priorities for what must be automated
You’ll orchestrate the process so both roles work cohesively.
Test Design & Execution
Write clear, structured test cases
Define regression sets
Perform exploratory testing
Validate complex user flows
Confirm fixes and check for collateral damage
Ensure coverage for edge cases and risk zones
Automation Oversight
You are not required to write automation code, but you must:
Decide what should be automated
Evaluate test stability
Review coverage
Direct automation work as part of the larger QA strategy
Required Experience (Structured and Clear)
To succeed here, you must have:
SaaS Product Experience
4+ years testing SaaS applications (multi-user, multi-permission, workflow-heavy systems)
Experience with content workflows, CRUD flows, or workflow tools
QA Leadership Experience
2+ years as a QA Lead or senior QA owning quality
Experience setting up or improving a QA process from scratch
Experience deciding release readiness
Hands-On Testing Ability
Strong manual testing skills
Ability to design regression suites
Comfort testing complex or multi-step flows
Expertise in exploratory testing
Experience catching usability and UX breakage
Technical QA Skills
Solid API testing experience (Postman, etc.)
Ability to read logs, inspect network calls, understand backend behavior
Experience working with staging/production parity
Basic familiarity with automation (not writing, but understanding its structure)
Environment & Process Experience
Has worked with CI/CD pipelines
Has worked with automation engineers or tools like Playwright/Cypress
Understands cross-browser testing
Understands how to collaborate with dev teams effectively
Comfortable pushing back on risky releases
Soft Skills Required
Communicates clearly with engineering
Thinks like a user, not just a tester
Highly organized and structured
Can drive accountability
Able to manage priorities under fast-paced conditions
Who Should NOT Apply
We want to be clear and save everyone time:
This is NOT a fit for someone who:
Has only done repetitive manual testing
Has only been part of a large QA department without leading
Cannot own a release decision
Has never managed regression suites
Has no SaaS or workflow product experience
Has automation-only experience with weak manual skills
Is uncomfortable coordinating with devs and PMs
This role requires ownership, leadership, and real judgment.
What Success Looks Like
Staging is always stable and trustworthy
Releases become predictable and low-risk
Manual QA and automation work in sync
Critical flows never break silently
Regression coverage improves monthly

Our app is built with a combination of React Native, Unity, and Construct-3 (Web). It is stable on iOS, and we are working to bring Android to the same level in both appearance and functionality. To streamline QA, we want to replace repetitive manual checks with an automated process that generates a clear bird’s-eye view of key app screens across devices.
== What we need now ==
We are looking to build a system that
- Automatically launches our app on multiple Android devices (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S24, Samsung Galaxy A34)
- Navigates to about 20–30 key screens
- Captures consistent screenshots of those screens
- Generates a clear consolidated report of screenshots per device and build
The system should be able to run both on demand (triggered manually during testing) and on a schedule to produce reports periodically for monitoring.
== Future scope ==
While our immediate need is Android, the solution should either work on iOS as well or be architected so that iOS devices can be added later without starting from scratch.
== How we’ll work together ==
- You will propose the best approach, design, and implement the automation
- Our engineering team will support you with anything app-specific such as test hooks and builds
- Once complete, you will hand over the process to our team for long-term maintenance and expansion
== Who we’re looking for ==
- Strong expertise in mobile test automation (Android required, iOS a plus)
- Hands-on experience with frameworks that can run on real devices (not just emulators)
- Familiarity with apps that combine multiple technologies such as React Native, Unity, and Web content is a strong advantage
- Solution-oriented: able to propose the right tools, deliver the process, and document it clearly
== Deliverable ==
- A working automation system that can be run on demand or scheduled for ongoing monitoring

Our users rely on us to give them a smooth, reliable, and fun experience, especially during the high-stress pre-enrollment phase when everything feels new and uncertain.
That’s where you come in. We’re looking for a freelance QA tester to help us maintain the quality and reliability of our product across platforms. You’ll be responsible for thoroughly testing our mobile app (built in Flutter) on both Android and iOS, as well as our web app. This includes both our staging and production environments, depending on where new features are being rolled out.
We’re not just looking for someone to run through a checklist — we want a curious and detail-oriented tester who can think like a user and help spot issues before students do. You’ll work closely with our product and dev teams to report bugs, check design consistency, validate features, and ensure that nothing slips through the cracks.
What the role looks like:

- Duration: 1–3 months (with potential to extend)
- Testing on both Android and iOS devices
- Web app testing across browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
- Working with staging and production builds

- Collaborating via GitHub

- You know how to write clear, actionable bug reports
- You have access to both Android and iOS devices
- You are familiar with automated testing
- You care about the little things — because our users definitely do
- Bonus points if you’ve worked with startups or student-focused platforms
- We’re a small team with a big mission — and your role will directly shape how thousands of students experience university life.

We are preparing to launch a new mobile application and are looking for experienced QA testers to perform in-depth functional and UX testing as a pair.
The app facilitates structured communication and scheduling between two users.
Because its features depend on user-to-user interaction, the test must be performed from both perspectives simultaneously.
If you are applying as a solo tester, please ensure you can test both roles using two devices (see details below).
Testing Setup Requirements:
iOS: You can install two versions of the app on one device, allowing you to test both user perspectives yourself.
Android: Only one version can be installed. Android testers must therefore have access to an iOS device as well, or work as part of a two-person testing pair (one using Android, one using iOS).
Responsibilities:
-Expected testing period: 3-5 days
-Conduct end-to-end manual testing across all features (registration, login, communication tools, scheduling, notifications, profile setup, etc.)
-Test two-way interactions between paired users
-Record and document bugs with clear reproduction steps, screenshots, and device/OS information

I am looking for a highly skilled N8N expert to help me build a robust automation flow that will allow me to post short-form educational video content on 7 Instagram accounts and 7 TikTok accounts – all secondary accounts intended to drive traffic to my main personal brand where I sell online courses.
What I need:
I want to be able to:
Upload a short video clip via Slack (preferred) or Telegram.
Provide 7 different headlines for the same video.
Automatically process the video by either:
Overlaying text/headlines on the video, or
Creating a split-screen or background video with an engaging second video (e.g. Fortnite gameplay or trending b-roll footage).
Schedule or directly post the modified videos to each of the 14 accounts (7 TikTok + 7 Instagram).
Key goals:
Automate the maximum part of the workflow to save time.
Use these secondary accounts to generate views and traffic back to the main account and offers.
Potentially include analytics, reposting, or A/B testing if feasible.
You can:
Propose improvements or creative ideas to optimize this automation.
Suggest best practices for handling mass posting to avoid shadowbanning or bans.
Propose efficient ways to handle video rendering, captioning, or watermarking via N8N or other tools in the stack.
Please include in your proposal:
Experience with similar automations, ideally for short-form video platforms.
How you would approach the video editing part (e.g. FFMPEG via N8N, API integrations, or external tools).
How you would handle the account authentication and posting part (e.g. through Meta’s and TikTok’s APIs or third-party services).
If you’ve already built a similar system, I’d love to see an example.

##ABOUT THE PROJECT
We are building **ReviewLoop**, a workflow-based system that coordinates paid book reviewers using Telegram, Google Sheets, Google Drive, PayPal payouts, and AI-generated content.
We have already started developing the automation with another freelancer, and a significant part of the initial structure is in place.
Now we are looking for a more experienced automation expert who can:
1. Complete what’s missing
2. Fix or clean up anything that needs improvement
3. Optimize the entire workflow for stability, scalability, and reliability
You will not start from scratch — the foundation exists — but we need someone who can take over with confidence and ensure the system works flawlessly.
---
## WHAT THE PROJECT INVOLVES
The workflow manages all activities after a reviewer joins our platform, including:
* Receiving new book details
* Generating reviews using AI (OpenAI or similar)
* Creating review “slots”
* Notifying reviewers via Telegram
* Handling confirmations and preventing overbooking
* Sending refunds for paid books (PayPal API)
* Collecting proof of published reviews
* Manual verification steps
* Batch payments every 10 verified reviews
* Internal notifications to our staff group

## YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
You will:
### 1. Review what has already been built:
* Check the current n8n scenarios
* Evaluate the logic, naming conventions, error handling, consistency, etc.
* Identify any weaknesses, inefficiencies, or potential race conditions
### 2. Continue building the remaining workflow steps
Half of the workflow still need to be completed and connected end-to-end.
### 3. Optimize and refactor where needed
We want the final system to be:
* Clean
* Modular
* Commented
* Fault-tolerant
* Easy to maintain and scale
### 4. Integrate APIs properly
Especially:
* Telegram Bot API (callback buttons, message flow, media handling)
* Google Sheets / Drive
* PayPal Payouts
* OpenAI or other AI models
### 5. Perform full testing
Simulate multiple reviewers, edge cases, slot limits, retries, etc.
---
## WHAT WE PROVIDE
* Full instructions (general + technical)
* A complete blueprint with workflow diagrams
* Database structure (Google Sheets)
* Message templates in multiple languages
* A partially completed n8n setup
* Support and quick clarification when needed
Your job is to **complete, refine, and finalize** the system.
---
## WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Someone who is:
* Senior-level in n8n
* Strong with chatbots (Telegram Bot API)
* Confident with Google APIs
* Familiar with PayPal Payout integrations
* Comfortable with complex multi-step async logic
* Able to refactor existing work when needed
* Detail-oriented and reliable
This is not a “build something simple” project — we need someone with engineering mindset, architecture thinking, and experience scaling automations.

They’ve been moving heavy equipment and parts from the U.S. to the Caribbean and Latin America for 20+ years. The business runs on trust, relationships… and workflows held together by fax, email threads, QuickBooks checkboxes and sheer willpower.
Your job: help me turn their napkins and index cards into a sane, semi-modern stack using AI and lightweight automation. No “innovation theatre.” Just less pain and fewer dropped balls.
What we actually need done
Think in phases, not fantasy platforms. Early focus:
•	Map and clean up the quoting and inventory flows
•	Stop using QuickBooks checkboxes as a pseudo-WMS and design something less insane
•	Turn messy inbound requests (email/WhatsApp/forms) into structured data
•	Auto-generate sane first drafts of quotes, status emails, and basic shipping docs
•	Build a simple internal “co-pilot” so the team can quickly see: who asked for what, what was quoted, what shipped, what’s pending
You’ll be working alongside me (fractional CMO / strategist) and their in-house team. I’ll handle the people, story, and change-management side; you handle the plumbing and prototypes.
What you should be good at
I don’t care which buzzwords you worship. I care that you can look at a messy real-world process and make it less stupid. Roughly, you should have:
•	Strong experience with AI assistants, API glue, and process automation (OpenAI / Claude / similar, plus Zapier/Make/n8n or your weapon of choice)
•	Solid understanding of data modeling and basic systems design (turn chaos into tables that make sense)
•	Comfort integrating with tools like QuickBooks Online and similar systems, or designing a light replacement layer around them
•	Experience in operations-heavy environments: logistics, supply chain, manufacturing, B2B services, etc. is a big plus
•	Ability to ship quick, ugly v1s that work, then refine
•	Clear communication: explain tradeoffs in plain English, not AI mysticism
How this will run
Phase 0: I’ll share my discovery notes, process map, and “this is how they really work” doc.
Phase 1: You propose a lean architecture and priority list: what we fix first, second, third.
Phase 2: Build and test a small set of high-impact automations (quoting + inventory sanity + basic comms).
Phase 3: If everyone’s still happy, we keep going deeper.
What to include in your reply
•	One or two examples of similar work where you untangled a messy, offline-heavy process
•	A short paragraph on how you’d approach replacing “QuickBooks checkboxes as inventory system” with something smarter but still simple
•	Your preferred stack and your hourly or project rate
If you’re the kind of person who sees a wall of manual checkboxes in QuickBooks and thinks “this is an opportunity, not a tragedy,” we should talk.",22.0,35.0,28.5,United States,United States,TRUE,Posted 5 days ago,2025-11-13T18:23:03.809Z,Hourly,Intermediate,,"PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, Java, AI Agent Development, AI App Development",Operation My agency,operation my agency,high,agency,seeking

The goal is to harden the current flow, fix a few regressions (scrolling, menu selection, image handling), and complete the remaining pieces so it’s reliable end-to-end. If we click, this can extend to ongoing maintenance as FB UI changes.
# What Exists Today
* Python project using Appium (UiAutomator2) against the Facebook app on Android emulator/phone
* CLI flow that can start from specific steps (resume capability)
* Logging, partial screenshots/source dumps, and multiple locator fallbacks (EN/FR)
* Core flows: open listing composer, fill fields, select category, attach images, publish
* Pain points:
* Unreliable scroll/tap in modal menus (e.g., “Select Category”, “More/Additional listing options”)
* Occasional re-taps on the wrong menu item
* Image upload (from local → emulator) and keeping original filenames
* Robustness to FB UI changes, view bounds, and dynamic elements
# Scope & Objectives
1. **Stabilize UI interactions**
* Reliable scroll/swipe in modals without closing them
* Deterministic selection of “Mobile Phones” and other categories (EN/FR)
* Distinguish “More listing options” vs “Additional listing options” consistently
2. **Image pipeline**
* Simple, documented method to push local images to emulator/device (ADB)
* Ensure filenames preserved where possible; confirm ordering and multi-image support
3. **Resilience & Observability**
* Fallback locator strategies (id/accessibility → text → XPath → bounds)
* Better retries/backoff, timeouts, and error screenshots/source dumps
* Structured logs that pinpoint step, locator used, and reason for retry/fail
4. **Developer UX**
* Keep the “start from step” CLI flag (resume) and make it bulletproof
* Clear README (Windows-focused), setup steps, emulator profile, and sample .env
* Minimal, focused changes to avoid regressions
5. **Final polish**
* “Done is done” publish flow with validation that the listing went live (or best proxy)
* Light test harness (smoke tests) for critical actions
# Deliverables
* Updated, working repository (Python) with:
* Fixed selectors & gestures for the key menus
* Image push & attach flow, with docs
* Improved logging/retries and error handling
* Updated README with setup/run instructions and known good emulator config
* Short “operating notes” (how to adapt if FB UI shifts)
* Optional: a few pytest or scriptable smoke checks (non-posting where feasible)
# Tech Stack & Environment
* Python 3.x
* Appium (UiAutomator2)
* Android emulator or physical device via ADB
* Windows 10/11 primary dev environment
* Facebook Android app (latest stable)
# Nice-to-Have Experience
* Robust Appium gestures (W3C actions), UiScrollable, and bounds-based taps
* Working around dynamic UIs/infinite scrolls and language variants (EN/FR)
* XPath optimization & accessibility id strategies
* Defensive automation (rate limiting, human-like pacing)
* Playwright/Selenium (for future web fallbacks)
* CI basics and meaningful logging
# Collaboration Style
* We value minimal, incremental changes that reduce regressions
* Clear commit messages and small PRs are preferred
* Bilingual FR/EN is a plus (we operate in Québec; timezone America/Toronto)
# Success Criteria
* Script can reliably: open composer → select correct category → fill fields → add multiple images → publish
* Menus no longer close due to bad swipes; categories picked correctly in EN/FR
* Logs/screenshots make failures easy to diagnose
* Fresh dev can follow the README and reproduce a successful run
# Estimated Budget & Engagement
* Fixed-price for an initial milestone (stabilize category/scroll + image flow), then hourly for hardening/maintenance.
* Please propose a phased plan with your estimate per phase.
# Notes on Compliance
* We seek reliability, not spammy behavior. Please build with sensible pacing, error handling, and respect for platform limits.",300.0,300.0,300.0,Canada,Canada,TRUE,Posted last week,2025-10-05T22:13:19.374Z,Fixed,Expert,,"Python, Android, Appium, Automation, Smartphone, Facebook Development",The goal,the goal,high,product_company,is_plain

The script must be integrable into n8n (via the code node), so it should be developed in Python or JavaScript, with clear documentation on how to import and execute it in my automation environment.
*Main Objectives:*
1. *Scraping from a search URL*
The script must be able to perform a search on PAP.fr from a full search URL (e.g., [https://www.pap.fr/annonce/location-appartement-maison-bouches-du-rhone-13-g376-4-pieces-a-partir-de-2-chambres-entre-100000-et-600000-euros-entre-30-et-200-m2](https://www.pap.fr/annonce/location-appartement-maison-bouches-du-rhone-13-g376-4-pieces-a-partir-de-2-chambres-entre-100000-et-600000-euros-entre-30-et-200-m2)).
It should extract all the listings on the results page, retrieve the URL of each ad, and then extract all public data from each listing:
* Title, description, price, property type, surface area, number of rooms, bedrooms, floor
* Precise location (neighborhood, city, postal code)
* Photos, listing reference, publication date
* Energy rating (DPE), type of heating, property condition
* Owner’s phone number (if visible)
* Additional information (proximity to public transport, schools, etc.)
The script must handle dynamic filters, AJAX loading, and anti-bot mechanisms (Cloudflare, etc.).
The output should be in JSON or CSV format, with a clear and usable structure.
2. *Automating message sending*
The script should fill in and submit the contact form on the listing page.
The message should be customizable (with input for personalized text).
The script should return a status: success, failure, message already sent, etc.
I am wondering if it might be wise to create two separate scripts: one for scraping and one for message sending. This would allow us to handle the scraping in our database (currently Airtable), then trigger the message sending by selecting listings from the database (we’ll handle the selection process).
*Technical Constraints:*
* The script must operate without a graphical interface (headless).
* It must be compatible with n8n.
* It must handle proxies.
* Include basic error handling and logging.
* Provide a README with:
* Necessary dependencies
* Installation steps
* An example of an n8n call
*Required Skills:*
* Expertise in web scraping (dynamic sites, JavaScript, anti-bot protections).
* Experience with PAP.fr or similar sites (leboncoin, seloger, etc.).
* Knowledge of n8n or other automation tools (Zapier, Make).
* A good understanding of the legal and ethical limits of scraping (GDPR, T&Cs).
* Ability to properly document code.
*Deliverables:*
* A functional script in Python or JavaScript.
* A complete README.md file.
*How to Apply:*
Please send me:
* Your experience with scraping (similar projects, tools used).
* A code sample (GitHub or attachment).
* Your time and budget estimate.

I run a fashion dropshipping brand and want to fully automate the creative production process for my Meta and TikTok ads.
The goal is simple: when I paste a product link (from AliExpress, supplier sites, or my Shopify backend), the system should automatically generate:
Clean, ad-ready product photos (no watermark, consistent lighting/background).
AI-generated fashion visuals in realistic lifestyle or model settings (via NanoBanana API or similar).
Short AI video ads (5–10 seconds) generated via Sora / Pika Labs / Runway ML.
All outputs must automatically be saved in Google Drive, ready to use for ads.
What the Workflow Should Do:
Trigger: New product link is added (via Google Sheet, Notion, or direct input).
AI Step 1 – Image Extraction: Automatically scrape or extract all images from the product page.
AI Step 2 – Watermark Removal: Clean images using WatermarkRemover.io, Pixelbin.io, or Erase.bg API.
AI Step 3 – AI Image Generation (NanoBanana):
Generate new fashion visuals — e.g., product on model, different poses, clean studio backgrounds, or lifestyle scenes — to match fashion ad standards.
AI Step 4 – AI Video Creation:
Use Sora, Pika Labs, or Runway ML API to generate a realistic short video (9:16 or 1:1) showing product movement or model-style clips.
AI Step 5 – Delivery:
Save both image and video files in Google Drive, in folders named after the product (e.g., /Ready Ads/Product_Name/).
Requirements:
Workflow must be fully automated (hands-free).
Must integrate AI tools via Make.com, Zapier, or custom Python script.
Cleaned and generated content should meet ad-quality standards (sharp, bright, 1080×1080 or 4:5).
Support bulk input of multiple product links.
Short Loom video + brief documentation explaining setup.
Preferred Tools & APIs:
NanoBanana API – for generating new model/lifestyle images
WatermarkRemover.io / Pixelbin.io – for watermark cleanup
Sora / Pika Labs / Runway ML – for AI video generation
Clipdrop / Replicate – for image enhancement
Google Drive + Sheets + Make.com / Zapier – automation orchestration layer
Ideal Freelancer:
Experience with AI automation pipelines (Make, Zapier, or API scripting)
Strong understanding of AI image & video generation
Familiar with e-commerce creative production (preferably fashion or dropshipping)

I need to do some preparations, so please don't start testing until I tell you that you can begin.
Task Requirement: You need to be a local resident of Panama/Peru/Ecuador. Please insert the SIM cards from different carriers into two separate phones. When I tell you that you can start making calls, you can start making calls and recording the screen (both A and B phones need to record the screen to ensure there is sound). So here are the steps. First, I will give you one new number. You need to call this number from your A phone and then observe whether your B phone can receive the call from your A phone at this time. If it can, please answer it and test whether the call can be made normally. If not, please proceed to the second step. Second, you need to call the number I gave you from mobile phone B and observe whether mobile phone A can receive the call from mobile phone B. Similarly, if possible, please connect and test whether the call can proceed normally. If it doesn't work, please give me feedback.
The documents you need to submit include：
1.	Screen recordings (with sound enabled)
2.	Screenshots of your call history/logs (showing numbers, duration, etc.)
Before the test starts, I want you to ensure that the audio permission for screen recording is enabled. If you cannot enable it, see if you can ask someone else to help record a video beside you.
Also, please note the following points:
1. Check if the calls can be connected: Call the new number from Phone A to see if Phone B answers, and call the new number from Phone B to see if Phone A answers. Please let me know the result: whether both calls were connected, only one call was connected (and specify which phone call the new number when the call is connected), or neither call was connected.
2. If the calls cannot be connected, please keep the screen recording running and listen for any prompt tones. The recording should last for more than 30 seconds. (you could tell me what the automated voice message said. Thank you.）
3. If the calls are connected, please speak a few words, as we need to confirm if the call quality is normal.
During the process of making and answering calls, it is necessary to record the screen content of both phones. This will facilitate our subsequent troubleshooting to identify whether the issue lies in making the call or answering it.
After finishing the recording, please check if the recorded video has audio.",15.0,15.0,15.0,China,China,TRUE,Posted 4 weeks ago,2025-09-17T09:29:50.853Z,Fixed,Entry Level,,Smartphone,If this requirement,if this requirement,high,individual_or_undefined,is_plain

We’re hiring a QA Engineer – someone detail-obsessed, technically sharp, and confident moving across web, iOS, and backend environments (including MCP server). This is a hands-on quality role embedded directly into our product and engineering teams, ensuring we ship reliable, secure, and seamless digital health experiences to millions of patients.
You’ll champion quality end-to-end: writing and maintaining automated tests, performing deep exploratory testing, debugging complex issues, and working closely with developers to build quality into the product from the very start.

- Conduct deep exploratory testing, regression testing, and edge-case investigations

- Collaborate closely with developers, PMs, designers, and other QAs
- Ensure quality is built in early — not inspected in at the end
- Contribute to test plans, documentation, and ongoing process improvements
- Validate releases and ensure smooth deployments across multiple environments
- Help raise the overall testing standards and practices across the engineering team
You’ll be central to catching issues early, shipping better features faster, and supporting the team in delivering safe, reliable digital health products to millions of users.

- Experience writing and maintaining automated test scripts
- Ability to identify, debug, and localise complex issues

What You’ll Do
Build and maintain automations between business tools (Salesforce, QuickBooks, WMS, Stripe, Google Sheets, etc.) using APIs, webhooks, or lightweight Python scripts.
Support integrations between SQL databases and cloud apps — helping ensure data flows cleanly between systems.
Maintain simple AWS scripts or cloud functions (Lambda, S3) that run scheduled jobs or data syncs.
Collaborate with the analytics team to feed cleaned data into dashboards and reports.
Troubleshoot automation failures and continuously improve reliability.
Document workflows and maintain clean version control (GitHub, Notion, or similar).
Ideal Background
2–5 years of experience in automation, integration, or data engineering.
Proficiency in Python (for small-to-medium automations and API work).
Solid understanding of SQL and data syncing concepts.
Experience connecting SaaS tools or CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, etc.).
Comfortable working with APIs, webhooks, and JSON data.
Familiarity with AWS basics (Lambda, S3, EC2, etc.) or other cloud automation tools.
Good communication and documentation habits — able to collaborate remotely with business and technical teams.
Nice to Have
Experience with Zapier, Make.com, or custom integration platforms.
Familiarity with ETL tools, Power BI, or data pipelines.
Background in logistics, 3PL, or industrial-tech environments (bonus but not required).

About Us
Atomic Digital Marketing (atomicdigitalmarketing.co.uk) is a fast-growing UK-based digital marketing agency. We build high-performing, design-led websites for clients across a wide range of industries.
We’re looking for a freelance QA tester to help us review and test our developed websites before launch — ensuring they perfectly match the design files, function flawlessly, and deliver an excellent user experience.
Role Overview
This is not a developer or designer role, but an eye for detail is essential. You’ll compare finished websites to their Figma designs, checking everything from spacing and typography to colour accuracy and animations. You’ll also test forms, buttons, navigation, and interactive elements to ensure everything works as intended.
Design and dev experience is not required, but would be a plus as it helps when spotting layout and aesthetic issues.
Responsibilities
- Compare live/staging websites against Figma designs to ensure a pixel-perfect match.
- Check layout accuracy — spacing, padding, font sizes, colours, and alignment.
- Test all interactive elements — buttons, forms, links, menus, animations, and effects.
- Review animations (GSAP or CSS) to confirm smoothness, responsiveness, and adherence to design.
- Test websites across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers for responsiveness and compatibility.
- Log clear, actionable feedback for the development team.
- Retest after fixes to confirm issues are resolved.
Requirements
- Strong attention to detail — able to spot even small design and functional inconsistencies.
- Experience with website QA or front-end review (agency experience a plus).
- Familiarity with design-to-development workflows (Figma knowledge preferred).
- Comfortable testing on multiple devices and browsers.
- Strong communication skills for providing concise, structured feedback.
Nice-to-Have Skills
- Background in web design or front-end development.
- Familiarity with animation libraries like GSAP (for testing animation accuracy).
- Understanding of basic HTML/CSS for communicating issues more effectively.
What We Offer
- Flexible remote working.
- Consistent freelance work on varied, high-quality web projects.
- Collaborative team environment.
- Clear design files and staging links for every project.",10.0,18.0,14.0,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,TRUE,Posted 2 months ago,2025-08-08T09:38:16.107Z,Hourly,Intermediate,,"Test Design, Component Testing, End-to-End Testing, Performance Testing",This,this,high,agency,is_plain

We’re preparing for a high-stakes pre-beta launch of a next-gen fashion-tech app (iOS + Android + Web) built at the intersection of fashion and AI.
We’re looking for a meticulous QA specialist who thrives on precision - someone who can validate every flow, every pixel, and every payment across devices, OS versions, and browsers on our latest builds to ensure a stable, secure, and confident launch.
This is a short, structured sprint with real impact: your work will determine whether we go live confidently or stall at the gate. You’ll collaborate closely with our distributed dev team, get access to Firebase, Razorpay sandbox, and restricted GCP modules, and play a key role in making the product bulletproof before launch.
Scope of Work
You’ll own QA across iOS, Android, and Web on our latest builds in Light & Dark Modes, covering:
1. Functional & UI Testing
•	Onboarding flows, persona logic, and profile journeys
•	Conversational AI interface behavior
•	Wardrobe save/edit/tag functions
•	Subscription and payment success/failure/retry flows
•	Toggle logic between user plans
•	Cloud Function triggers (e.g., onSaveLook, fetchNewLook)
•	UI rendering across screens, buttons, and navigations
•	Cross-device and OS version testing across iOS & Android
2. Web UI & Marketing Page Validation
•	Responsive checks for key flows on the web version (home, onboarding, lookbook, wardrobe, profile, subscription)
•	Cross-browser checks (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox – latest versions)
•	Validation of marketing landing page (content rendering, navigation, forms, CTAs)
•	Alignment between app and web versions for consistency
3. Infra & Data Readiness
•	Firestore rules & doc-level permission testing
•	Firebase function triggers, header validation, fallback checks
•	Token/session integrity across login methods (Apple, Facebook, OTP)
•	Storage URL safety & environment protection
•	UserID linkage to looks, subscriptions, and logs
4. Security & Stability Checks
•	Penetration tests (token replay, API abuse, rate limits)
•	Endpoint/header injection probes
•	Razorpay sandbox masking & validation
•	Smoke testing before each release
•	Regression testing to prevent old bugs from resurfacing
5. Exploratory & Network Testing
•	Exploratory testing simulating real-user behavior
•	Performance across networks (slow Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G, fast Wi-Fi)
Deliverables & Milestones (Fixed Fee $300)
We work in structured phases to reduce risk. Fixed payouts are milestone-based (M1-M4); the variable discretionary performance bonus is separate.
M1 - Setup & Sanity (10%) - $30
•	Test credentials configured on builds
•	Initial smoke tests on key flows
•	Security & data sanity checks logged
M2 - Functional & Web UI Testing (20%) - $60
•	Full functional + UI testing across iOS & Android
•	Responsive checks for Web UI & marketing page
•	Structured bug tracker (screenshots/ videos in Trello)
M3 - Regression, Security & Cross-Device Testing (50%) - $150
•	Device/OS coverage across Android & iOS
•	Regression testing on new builds
•	Security & network variation checks
•	Closure confirmed for critical bugs
M4 - Final QA Report & Handover (20%) - $60
•	Final QA summary & sign-off document
•	Retest of patched builds
•	Preparation for launch
Discretionary Bonus (up to $200)
A discretionary performance bonus may be released after the beta launch, in two back-ended stages linked to early risk detection and post-launch stability.
Stage 1 – Beta Launch Sign-off (40%)
Paid after the public beta launch once:
•	All high-risk defects (crash, data leak, payment failure, login/session breach) have been identified early and closed or validated as resolved.
•	No critical blockers appear in the first two weeks of beta usage.
•	If any high-risk issue surfaces post-launch that should reasonably have been caught during QA, the corresponding bonus portion may be docked proportionally.
Stage 2 – Post-Launch Stability (60%)
Paid 30 days after beta launch, provided:
•	No new high-risk issues arise in previously tested flows.
•	Fewer than 3 medium-risk or 10 low-risk cosmetic bugs remain open.
•	No security regressions (MITM, token reuse, API exposure) are detected.
•	Tester remains available for clarification and limited retesting support.
Note:
The bonus is discretionary and contingent upon post-launch performance and early-capture prudence, not raw bug count.
Out-of-scope or new-feature issues introduced after QA hand-off are excluded.
Engagement Rules
•	Milestone-based contract, not open-ended hourly. Deliverables = payouts.
•	All bugs must include device/OS, repro steps, expected vs. actual, and screenshots/videos.
•	Vague comments like “works on some devices” won’t cut it. If it’s not reproducible, it’s not usable.
•	Clear scope, clear payouts. No surprises, no detours. Anything outside contract is grounds for instant termination with no payouts - we work on trust and professionalism.
•	All comms/deliverables through Upwork/Trello/Slack for transparency & safety.
Ideal Candidate
•	Proven QA experience in mobile apps (iOS + Android) and web UI/landing page testing
•	Hands-on with Firebase/Firestore apps
•	Familiar with payment flows (Razorpay or similar)
•	Skilled in login/session testing (Apple, Facebook, OTP)
•	Strong in functional, regression, exploratory, and UI testing
•	Able to simulate network variation & basic penetration checks
•	Excellent English, structured bug reporting, fast turnaround
Screening Questions

We are looking for 1–3 experienced payment testers based in the United States who can help us reproduce and diagnose an issue with D7 rebills (7-day auto-renew charges) on Visa/Mastercard cards.
This is NOT a scam, NO card linking on third-party websites, and NO sharing of banking credentials.
You will simply make a real purchase (a $1 trial), wait 7 days, and observe how your bank processes the automatic renewal.
We ONLY require:
– a real US-issued Visa Debit or Visa/Mastercard card
– optionally: device with Apple Pay
– willingness to record screen + note banking notifications
What you will do:
You will go through a standard subscription flow like a regular customer:
Create an account (you will use your own email).
Purchase a $1 trial (via Visa or Apple Pay).
Wait for the auto-renewal on Day 7 ($45).
Record what happens during the rebill:
Was the charge approved?
If declined:
What decline code appeared? (Issuer decline / Do Not Honor / Generic decline)
Did you receive any SMS/email/push from your bank?
Did Apple Pay show “verify transaction”?
Did nothing happen at all?
Requirements:
✔ Must be located in the United States
✔ Must have a US-issued Visa Debit card (top priority)
✔ Mastercard testers are also welcome
✔ Ability to record screen on iPhone/Android
✔ Comfortable doing one real payment test
✔ Card must have at least $50 balance for auto-renewal attempt
✔ 7-day availability to observe the rebill
Nice to have:
• Apple Pay enabled
• Prior experience as payment tester / QA on fintech products
• Ability to test from more than one card (extra paid)
Compensation:
$80–$150 per test cycle (per card)
additional bonus for testers who can test 2–3 cards
we reimburse the $1 trial fee
This is a one-time task with potential for ongoing collaboration for other GEOs.
Why this is legit:
We are a US/EU-based product company researching issuer-side decline reasons for recurring payments.
We do NOT request:
card numbers
login credentials
screenshots of sensitive card data
Only what your bank normally shows during legitimate purchases.
To Apply:
Please answer:
Your country + state

Stage-Gate for Releases: You will serve as the final quality checkpoint before new releases go live.

The automation should take care of every step from pulling raw content, rewriting it into optimized thread-style posts, adding visuals, and then posting them — all while allowing us to approve or edit drafts quickly.
This project will require a mix of API integration, workflow automation, natural language processing, and social media posting tools. If you have prior experience creating content workflows powered by LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.), generating images via DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or Midjourney wrappers, and posting programmatically to X using its developer tools, this project is a perfect fit.
Our goal is to create a repeatable, polished content pipeline that saves hours each week and ensures every piece of content looks professional and aligned with our brand’s style.
The Flow We Want (Step by Step)
To give clarity, here is the exact flow we need automated:
Pull Scripts from Google Sheets
We maintain a master content calendar in Google Sheets. Each row includes a short script (a few paragraphs) originally designed for Instagram carousel posts.
The automation should be able to pull scripts from this sheet based on a daily or weekly trigger (configurable).
Rewrite Script into X Thread Format
Each script should be passed into an LLM (Claude or OpenAI GPT).
The LLM’s job: Rewrite the single Instagram script into a 6–10 post X thread.
Threads should be formatted in Marketing_Nerd style: clear, concise, punchy, psychology-driven, and engaging.
Example: If the original IG script is 300 words long, it should be broken into bite-sized posts that flow logically as a thread.
Visual Generation for Each Tweet
For each tweet in the thread, we want to attach a relevant visual. Options:
AI-generated images via DALL·E, Stability AI, or Midjourney (using a bot wrapper API).
Or a curated image pulled from a stock image API (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels API).
Ideally, visuals should be aligned with the content’s tone (marketing/psychology/business themes).
Example: If the thread is about “anchoring bias in retail pricing,” we might want a price tag visual, shopping cart illustration, or psychology sketch.
Draft Thread Compilation
The rewritten thread (text + images) should be compiled into a preview draft.
This draft should be sent to us for review before posting.
Confirmation Step
Before any post goes live, the draft thread should be sent to us via a confirmation channel. Options include:
Slack (via webhook or bot).
Telegram bot.
Or even email, if that’s easier.
We want the ability to approve, edit, or reject the draft thread before it gets scheduled.
Posting to X
Once approved, the automation should automatically post the full thread on our X account.
Posting should ideally use the X API, but if polish is easier through third-party tools (Typefully, Hypefury, etc.), we are open to that.
Technical Requirements
To make sure we attract the right developer, here’s a breakdown of the technical elements required:
Google Sheets API Integration
Read scripts from specific sheets/columns.
Trigger pulling content on a daily/weekly schedule.
Mark rows as “processed” once completed.
LLM API Integration
Use Claude (Anthropic) or OpenAI GPT.
Prompt engineering to ensure threads are rewritten in the desired style.
Ability to handle text limits (each tweet must fit within 280 characters, including spaces).
Image Generation or Retrieval
API integration with at least one of the following:
DALL·E (OpenAI Images API).
Stability AI.
Midjourney wrapper (Discord bot automation via API).
Or curated stock photo APIs.
Logic for aligning visuals with thread text.
Confirmation Step Integration
Slack or Telegram bot.
Send preview (thread text + visuals).
Approve/reject workflow (button or simple text command).
X API or Posting Service Integration
Direct posting to X (thread with images).
Or use a polished tool like Typefully or Hypefury with API access.
Must support scheduled posts (in case we approve but want future publishing).
Error Handling
If the LLM fails, retry automatically.
If image generation fails, use fallback stock visuals.

I’ve been working with AI automation part-time for the last 5 months, but I don’t have a proper technique for developing bots and selling them. I know the basics — I’ve worked with n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Botpress, same.new, Replit, etc.
The problem is, when I get a client who wants AI automation, I don’t know where to start. I just outsource, which creates a bad loop. I need to learn how to properly build and ship agents — what programs to use, how to plan, and finally how to sell them.
